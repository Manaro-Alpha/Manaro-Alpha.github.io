I am a Final Year undergrad at BITS Pilani Goa Campus majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am interested in Robotics and Reinforcement Learning.

Currently, I am working as a Research Intern at [Swaayatt Robots](https://www.swaayattrobots.com/) where I work closely with [Mr Sanjeev Sharma](https://www.swaayattrobots.com/)(Founder and CEO, Swaayatt Robots) on Motion Planning using Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicles.

Previously, I was a Research Intern at [MARMot Lab](https://www.marmotlab.org/), National University of Singapore working under the guidance of [Dr Guillaume Sartoretti](https://www.marmotlab.org/bio.html) and his research group on Foothold Planning using Reinforcement Learning for Legged Robots. Even before that, I was a Research Intern at CSIR-CEERI under the guidance of [Dr Kaushal Kishore](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/kaushal-kishore/).
